		<h2>Project Overview</h2>
		<p>
			We created this web application to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for managing and
			rendering dynamic content. Using Go for server-side handling, We ensured that the frontend remains
			responsive and robust. The goal was to make the process of serving templates, managing routes, and
			handling state as efficient as possible. This project showcases our approach to modern web development,
			with a strong focus on modularity, performance, and scalability.

		<h2>Key Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Dynamic Template Rendering with caching mechanism for efficient HTML template delivery.</li>
			<li>Routing and Request Handling through Goâ€™s multiplexer for smooth navigation.</li>
			<li>State Management using a singleton pattern, ensuring consistent application state across requests.</li>
			<li>Frontend Asset Management with well-organized HTML templates, CSS, JavaScript, and images.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
		<p>In developing this project, I utilized a modern tech stack:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Go (Golang):</strong> The backbone of the project, handling server-side operations, routing, and state management.</li>
			<li><strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript:</strong> For creating the structure and enhancing the user interface with interactive elements.</li>
			<li><strong>Multiplexer (mux):</strong> Efficiently routes and links URL patterns to their corresponding handlers.</li>
			<li><strong>Template Caching:</strong> Speeds up the rendering of static HTML templates.</li>
			<li><strong>Singleton Pattern:</strong> Ensures a single instance of the application state, reducing complexity and improving performance.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
		<p>
			We structured the application in a modular way, separating concerns for clarity and maintainability:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Server:</strong> Initializes and manages the web server.</li>
			<li><strong>Handlers:</strong> Uses the <code>Repo</code> struct to centralize application state and rendering logic.</li>
			<li><strong>Models:</strong> Contains the <code>App</code> struct for consistent template data management.</li>
			<li><strong>Renders:</strong> Handles HTML template rendering and HTTP responses.</li>
			<li><strong>Routers:</strong> Manages URL routing and links URL patterns to the appropriate handlers.</li>
			<li><strong>Views:</strong> Contains all the assets like HTML templates, CSS, JavaScript, and images.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

		<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
		<p>
			One of the biggest challenges We faced was optimizing template rendering while maintaining clean and modular code. 
			Implementing a template caching mechanism greatly improved response times. 
			Managing state across various routes was another challenge, which we tackled using a singleton pattern for the <code>App</code> struct. 
			These solutions ensure the application runs smoothly and efficiently.
